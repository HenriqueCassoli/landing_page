          <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

           <h2>Lorem ipsum</h2>
           <p>A expressão Lorem ipsum em design gráfico e editoração é um texto padrão em latim utilizado na produção gráfica para preencher os espaços de texto em publicações para testar e ajustar aspectos visuais antes de utilizar conteúdo real.Em sua forma mais comum, o texto é como se segue:
            "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam eget ligula eu lectus lobortis condimentum. Aliquam nonummy auctor massa. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Nulla at risus. Quisque purus magna, auctor et, sagittis ac, posuere eu, lectus. Nam mattis, felis ut adipiscing."
            Nos países de língua inglesa o texto apresenta-se em forma um pouco diferente, apresentada a seguir:
            "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

              <h3>Two-Seam Fastball</h3>
              <p>A two-seam fastball is generally one of a pitcher's fastest pitches, although it doesn't have quite the same velocity as a four-seam fastball. A two-seam fastball is one of the most frequently thrown pitches in baseball.
              A two-seam fastball is often a few ticks slower than a four-seam fastball, but it tends to have more movement. With a two-seamer, the ball moves in the same direction as whichever arm is being used to throw it (meaning a right-handed 
              pitcher gets rightward movement on a two-seamer).</p>

                <h3>Curveball</h3>
                <p>A curveball is a breaking pitch that has more movement than just about any other pitch. It is thrown slower and with more overall break than a slider, and it is used to keep hitters off-balance.
                   When executed correctly by a pitcher, a batter expecting a fastball will swing too early and over the top of the curveball.
                  Most professional pitchers possess either a curveball or a slider -- and some possess both breaking pitches. Having a breaking pitch, like a curveball, is an essential component to a
                   professional starter's arsenal, because it keeps the hitter off-balance and unable to commit to gearing up exclusively for a fastball.
                  The curveball has been one of the most commonly used pitches throughout baseball history, and the universally accepted signal for a curveball is a catcher putting down two fingers.
                  The pitch is so well known in American culture that the phrase "throw a curveball" has emerged as an idiom. Like the goal of pitchers when throwing the pitch, the idiom "to throw a 
                  curve" means to trick someone with something unexpected.</p>

                <h3>Slider</h3>
               <p>A slider is a breaking pitch that is thrown faster and generally with less overall movement than a curveball. It breaks sharply and at a greater velocity than most other breaking pitches.
                The slider and the curveball are sometimes confused because they generally have the same purpose -- to deceive the hitter with spin and movement away from a pitcher's arm-side. 
                 (When a pitch seems to toe the line between the two, it is referred to in slang as a "slurve.")
                Most professional pitchers possess either a slider or a curveball -- and some possess both breaking pitches. Having a breaking pitch, like a slider, is an essential component to a professional starter's arsenal, 
                because it keeps the hitter a bit off-balance and unable to commit to gearing up exclusively for a fastball.
                A slider is meant to be slightly more deceptive than a curveball because it is thrown harder and has spin that more closely resembles a fastball -- although it doesn't create as much overall movement. 
                Many power relief pitchers possess only a fastball and a slider in their arsenals -- 
                with one pitch setting up the other because of the late deception created by the slider.</p>
